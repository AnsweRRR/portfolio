    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I've been working in software development for 5 years, mainly with .NET, and I feel most at home on the backend. That said, I'm also comfortable with frontend development, primarily using React. I enjoy learning new things, so I occasionally dive into mobile development (React Native) and desktop apps (Electron) as well. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself."
